# Phi-Algebra
In phi algebra, numbers are represented in form of (A+Bϕ)/(C+Dϕ) where A,B,C and D are integers and ϕ is an irrational number equal to one plus square root of five divided by two (the golden ratio).

ϕ demonstrates interesting properties, one of them beeing the fact that ϕ squared is equal to ϕ+1.

This C++ interface enables two-way conversion and performic algebraic operations on phi expressions.
